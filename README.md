ECE385_VHDL
==============
A project written for the "ECE385: Digital Systems Laboratory" course at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). 
This was done in collaboration with partner Sai Koppula.

This code base may contain content based on course material.
Contact UIUC for distribution.
Please do not use this for your own ECE 385 work. After all, the satisfaction of getting your FPGA working is great!
