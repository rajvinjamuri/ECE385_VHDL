ECE385_VHDL
===========

Copies of the VHDL files written for a joint project (with Sai Koppula) for ECE 385 at UIUC.

This code contains a lot of content which is based on material provided for course instruction and is not mine to share.
Please do not use this for your own ECE 385 work. After all, the satisfaction of getting your FPGA working is great!
